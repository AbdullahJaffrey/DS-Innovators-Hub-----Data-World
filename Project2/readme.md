# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook (HousingPriceLinearRegression.ipynb) explores the housing dataset, performing analysis and linear regression modeling to predict house prices. The project aims to understand the factors affecting house prices and build a predictive model.

**Dataset**: The dataset (Housing.csv) is used for the project and includes the following features:

- **Price**: The selling price of the house in Rs.
- **Area**: Total property size in square feet.
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms in the house.
- **Stories**: Number of stories (excluding the basement).
- **Mainroad**: Indicates if the house faces a main road (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Livingroom**: Indicates whether the house has a separate living/drawing room for guests (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Basement**: Shows if the house has a basement (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Hotwaterheating**: Indicates if the house uses gas for hot water heating (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Airconditioning**: Indicates if the house has central air conditioning (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **Parking**: Number of cars that can be parked.
- **Prefarea**: Indicates if the house is located in a preferred neighborhood (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
