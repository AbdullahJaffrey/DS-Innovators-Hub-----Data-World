# Titanic Dataset Project

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook (TitanicEDA.ipynb) explores the Titanic dataset, implementing analysis and visualization of passenger information. The project aims to gain insights into factors influencing survival on the Titanic.

Dataset: The dataset (titanic.csv) is provided by Data Science Dojo and includes the following features:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
